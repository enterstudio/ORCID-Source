# Manual Test

The client iDs and secrets used for testing can be found in passpack.

## If working with windows

Known Issues:

Git bash present issues with the format of the scope, i.e. Instruction 43. 

Solution (easiest one):

Download Vagrant (https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/installation/) and virtual box (https://www.virtualbox.org/).

Follow the instructions on vagrant getting started guide to get your basic environment.

Known problems:
Once Vagrant Up has been run, you must run "vagrant ssh". It is possible that ssh is not added to your environment variables and this will cause an error that will be reported in the console.

To add ssh you need to install git. After this, proceed to add the following path to your PATH environment variable: C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin (or wherever git is installed on your system).

After this you should be able to enter the vagrant enviroment. There you will need to install curl ($ sudo apt-get install curl).

Now you are ready to start your tests.

NOTE: After instruction 58 you will need to use some files located on your system.

Please read this guide on how to do this: https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/getting-started/synced_folders.html

Short story: copy your folder with the tests inside your vagrant folder. I.e: C:\_work\vagrant\manual-test. Update the path inside the curl command with "@/vagrant/manual-test/ma_work.xml" matching the name of your folder.

118. Generate a new token with the same scopes and expiration as the 2.0 token and do not revoke the original token

    ```
    curl -i -L -k -H 'Authorization: Bearer [2.0 token]' -d 'refresh_token=[2.0 refresh]' -d 'grant_type=refresh_token' -d 'client_id=[client id]' -d 'client_secret=[client secret]' -d 'revoke_old=false' https://qa.orcid.org/oauth/token
    ```

119. Use the newly generated refreshed token to post the test work

    ```
    curl -H 'Content-Type: application/orcid+xml' -H 'Authorization: Bearer [refreshed1]' -H 'Accept: application/xml' -d '@ma2_work.xml' -X POST 'https://api.qa.orcid.org/v2.0/[orcid id]/work' -L -i -k
    ```

120. Check that the original token still works by reading the record

    ```
    curl -H 'Content-Type: application/orcid+xml' -H 'Authorization: Bearer [2.0 token]' -H 'Accept: application/xml' 'https://api.qa.orcid.org/v2.0/[orcid id]/record' -L -i -k
    ```

121. Generate a new token with a short lifespan, only /read-limited scope and revoke the original token    

    ```
    curl -i -L -k -H 'Authorization: Bearer [2.0 token]' -d 'refresh_token=[2.0 refresh]' -d 'grant_type=refresh_token' -d 'client_id=[client id]' -d 'client_secret=[client secret]' -d 'revoke_old=true' -d 'scope=/read-limited' -d 'expires_in=600' https://qa.orcid.org/oauth/token
    ```

122. Find and replace [refreshed2] in this document with the token you just generated

123. Check the new token can't be used to post items by attempting to post the test work. Check that you get a 403 Forbidden error with error code 9038

    ```
    curl -H 'Content-Type: application/orcid+xml' -H 'Authorization: Bearer [refreshed2]' -H 'Accept: application/xml' -d '@ma2_work.xml' -X POST 'https://api.qa.orcid.org/v2.0/[orcid id]/work' -L -i -k
    ```

124. Check the original token was revoked by attempting to post the test work. A 401 Unauthorized error with the message "Invalid access token...: should be returned

    ```
    curl -H 'Content-Type: application/orcid+xml' -H 'Authorization: Bearer [2.0 token]' -H 'Accept: application/xml' -d '@ma2_work.xml' -X POST 'https://api.qa.orcid.org/v2.0/[orcid id]/work' -L -i -k
    ```

125. Check that the new token can be used to read the record. The full record should be returned

    ```
    curl -H 'Content-Type: application/orcid+xml' -H 'Authorization: Bearer [refreshed2]' -H 'Accept: application/xml' 'https://api.qa.orcid.org/v2.0/[orcid id]/record' -L -i -k
    ```

126. Check that you can't generate a refresh token using a revoked token. You should get an error message "Parent token is disabled"

    ```
    curl -i -L -k -H 'Authorization: Bearer [1.2 token]' -d 'refresh_token=[1.2 refresh]' -d 'grant_type=refresh_token' -d 'client_id=[client id]' -d 'client_secret=[client secret]' -d 'revoke_old=false' https://qa.orcid.org/oauth/token
    ```
